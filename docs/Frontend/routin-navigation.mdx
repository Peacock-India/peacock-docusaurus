# Routing and Navigation

In our frontend application, we use React Router for handling routing and navigation. React Router is a popular routing library for React applications that provides declarative routing capabilities.

## Installation

To install React Router Dom, you can use npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install react-router-dom

or

yarn add react-router-dom
```

## Building our Role-based access component

### To build our Role-based access component, we’ll follow this process;

* When an employee signs in, the employee’s role and JWT token are stored in the Auth state.

* When this employee requests access to a protected route, our role-based access component will access the Auth state and retrieve the employee’s role.
* The employee’s role will then be cross-checked with an array containing the required roles for that route.
* If the user’s role matches the required role, access is granted, else access will be denied.


Here’s the code for this;

```jsx
import { useLocation, Navigate, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
import { useContext } from "react";
import AuthContext from "../Context/authProvider";

import React from "react";

const Auth = ({ allowedRoles }) => {
  const { auth } = useContext(AuthContext);
  const location = useLocation();

  return allowedRoles.find((role) => auth.role.includes(role)) ? (
    <Outlet />
  ) : auth?.name ? (
    <Navigate to="/unauthorized" state={{ from: location }} replace />
  ) : (
    <Navigate to="/register" state={{ from: location }} replace />
  );
};

export default Auth;
```

With this done, we’ll wrap each protected route with this component and pass to this component the required role for each page;

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';
import Contact from './components/Contact';
import NotFound from './components/NotFound';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
    <Route path="/linkpage" element={<LinkPage />} />
    <Route path="/register" element={<Register />} />
    <Route path="/signin" element={<Signin />} />
    <Route path="/unauthorized" element={<Unauthorized />} />
    <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
    <Route element={<Auth allowedRoles={["marketer"]} />}>
      <Route path="/marketers-only" element={<MarketersPage />} />
    </Route>
    <Route element={<Auth allowedRoles={["se"]} />}>
      <Route path="/se-only" element={<SEPage />} />
    </Route>
    <Route element={<Auth allowedRoles={["se"]} />}>
      <Route path="/hr-Only" element={<HRPage />} />
    </Route>
  </Route>
</Routes>;
  );
};

export default App;
```

With these done, every group has access to only their specific route.
